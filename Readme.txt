About the directory tree:

    Source Directories:
    -   "src/" folder contains all the source codes including the contracts
    -   -   "src/contracts" folder contains source code of Solidity smart contracts
    -   -   "src/engine" folder contains the heart of the project. API implementations
                are in this folder.
        -   "src/test" folder contains ".spec.ts" codes which they contains test
                subjects and implementations. Tests are driven by Mocha encapsulated by
                Truffle framework to provide api between blockchain node and the tests.
        -   "src/ui" folder contains source codes of Electron application and its
                assets. It is a simple application to demonstrate the API.
        -   "src/utils" folder contains blockchain and contract utility modules.

    Generated Directories:
    -   "bundle/" directory gets generated by Webpack bundler. It contains bundled
            javascript and asset files of the Electron application.
    -   "lib/" directory gets generated by the Typescript compiler. It contains
            compiled javascript (from .ts files in "src/") files. They are
            used for running tests. Also the library will be published with the files
            in this directory.

            Note: Truffle will save compiled contract ABIs into the "lib/contracts/"
                directory.

About tests:
    Always execute "npm install" before making tests to compile sources.
    And always make sure there is a running Ganache instance: "npm run ganache"
    To execute tests run: "npm test" or "npm run test"

Starting electron application:
    "npm install"
    "npm run start"
